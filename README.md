# Front End Development with Vue.js - IT Academy

My sprints for IT Academy's Vue course. As I work through the exercises, I will document my progress in this page.

## **Sprint 1**

The first sprint consists in familiarizing yourself with **flexbox** (and **grid**, optionally) by building a blog-like website layout.

### ⭐ **Level 1** ⭐

**— Exercise 1**

Desktop version. Even though the content of the website is just simulated, I decided to apply [semantic HTML](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-section-your-html/) for practice.

### ⭐⭐ **Level 2** ⭐⭐

**— Exercise 4**

Add content and style the header.

##### ✅ Finished: 29/11/2022

**— Exercise 5**

Add content and style the rest of the page.

✏️**Notes:**

- I had to change the media query for the mobile view so it would activate earlier, because the layout was getting too squished before it'd switch to mobile view and it was hard making it look right.
- I also had to change the sidebar's width. At first I didn't give it any width and just made it have `flex-grow: 1` so it'd take up all the remaining space, which was fine while the sidebar had no content, but when I added text it expanded and made the `main` element shrink. So I had to give it a width of 30%.
